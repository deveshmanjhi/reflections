Q1)When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans->When many people are working on a project.
when you want to access your work from remote devices
when you want your data to online and safe

Q2)Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Ans->It so may be the case that suppose many people are working on the project and the owner has done some changes to it bbut
i don't like those changes then if git automatically upadted my local repository then it would have been of no use to me.
